# ARPESmainpanel
Igor procedure file to process ARPES data
Please put the mainpanel.ipf and newspectrasimulation.ipf files into the "Igor Procedures" folder in your Igor Pro path. The procedure would automatically compile once you start Igor Pro. The procedure requires Igor Pro 7.0 or later version.

mainpanel: a panel for dataload and generating other related panels for data viewing and processing;

newspectrasimulation: works for spectra simulation panel;

standard_igor_plotstyle: works for quick set of graph plot in Igor Pro;

Curvature - Peng ZHANG: works for second-order differential and curvature analysis for spectra data;

DFTbandload: quick load and plot for DFT-calculated data;

Expdatapanel: load and plot data from XRD, PPMS and XMCD;

twodimcolorplot: plot the two-dimensional polarized data (especially for CD-ARPES and spin-resolved ARPES);
